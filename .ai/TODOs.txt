Perform all actions through the main object, but don't be too specific. 
Everything should happen from the - do we even need fixed-points endpoints? I would say we could got with put/patch of the plan, either generated or drafted.
However, when it comes to endpoint for days of given plan I'm not entirely sure whether it's a good practice to perform 10x requests. We could do it in one: main plan with details, and then activities should be grouped by day.

Something to consider whether it's a good practice from a RESTful point of view.
